// Regular Expressions: Match Ending String Patterns
// In the last challenge, you learned to use the caret character to search for patterns at the beginning of strings. There is also a way to search for patterns at the end of strings.

// You can search the end of strings using the dollar sign character $ at the end of the regex.

// let theEnding = "This is a never ending story";
// let storyRegex = /story$/;
// storyRegex.test(theEnding);
// // Returns true
// let noEnding = "Sometimes a story will have to end";
// storyRegex.test(noEnding);
// // Returns false

// Use the anchor character ($) to match the string "caboose" at the end of the string caboose.

// You should search for "caboose" with the dollar sign $ anchor in your regex.
// Your regex should not use any flags.
// You should match "caboose" at the end of the string "The last car on a train is the caboose"

let caboose = "The last car on a train is the caboose";
let lastRegex = /caboose$/; // Change this line
let result = lastRegex.test(caboose);
